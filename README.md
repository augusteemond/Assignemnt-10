1.) Universal selectors are ususally indicated by an asterisk, it selects everything in the document or everything inside the parenthesise. Elements are the spectifc types of components in a givin HTML document. Class selectors look like this "(.)" and select everything in the document that has the class selector identified. These can be reffered to as highlights. ID selectors begin with a hashtag or pound sighn,"(#)." ID selectors can only be used once per page and can select an element with an ID set on it.
2.)My color pallet consists of Pink, White, and Black. They are nothing too crazy and really do not jump out of the page but they do look very clean togather. I chose to discribe the rock/grunge bands of the 1990s and I though the color pallet I chose would fit quite nicely into my HTML page.
I did not have too much trouble with this assignment but one of the problems I keep running into is my pictures not rendering on my html page. I cite my images file correctly but for some reason they do not show up on my page. Still trying to work thorugh this problem. I really do enjoy working in CSS with HTML because it makes the work more personal and intresting. Being creative with these assignments really is a challanging but fun time.
